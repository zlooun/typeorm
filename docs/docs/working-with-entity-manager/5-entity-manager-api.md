# `EntityManager` API

- `dataSource` - The DataSource used by `EntityManager`.

```typescript
const dataSource = manager.dataSource
```

- `queryRunner` - The query runner used by `EntityManager`.
  Used only in transactional instances of EntityManager.

```typescript
const queryRunner = manager.queryRunner
```

- `transaction` - Provides a transaction where multiple database requests will be executed in a single database transaction.
  Learn more [Transactions](../transactions.md).

```typescript
await manager.transaction(async (manager) => {
    // NOTE: you must perform all database operations using the given manager instance
    // it's a special instance of EntityManager working with this transaction
    // and don't forget to await things here
})
```

- `query` - Executes a raw SQL query.

```typescript
const rawData = await manager.query(`SELECT * FROM USERS`)

// You can also use parameters to avoid SQL injection
// The syntax differs between the drivers

// aurora-mysql, better-sqlite3, capacitor, cordova,
// expo, mariadb, mysql, nativescript, react-native,
// sap, sqlite, sqljs
const rawData = await manager.query(
    "SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE name = ? and age = ?",
    ["John", 24],
)

// aurora-postgres, cockroachdb, postgres
const rawData = await manager.query(
    "SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE name = $1 and age = $2",
    ["John", 24],
)

// oracle
const rawData = await manager.query(
    "SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE name = :1 and age = :2",
    ["John", 24],
)

// spanner
const rawData = await manager.query(
    "SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE name = @param0 and age = @param1",
    ["John", 24],
)

// mssql
const rawData = await manager.query(
    "SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE name = @0 and age = @1",
    ["John", 24],
)
```

- `sql` - Executes a raw SQL query using template literals.

```typescript
const rawData =
    await manager.sql`SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE name = ${"John"} and age = ${24}`
```

Learn more about using the [SQL Tag syntax](../guides/7-sql-tag.md).

- `createQueryBuilder` - Creates a query builder use to build SQL queries.
  Learn more about [QueryBuilder](../query-builder/1-select-query-builder.md).

```typescript
const users = await manager
    .createQueryBuilder()
    .select()
    .from(User, "user")
    .where("user.name = :name", { name: "John" })
    .getMany()
```

- `hasId` - Checks if given entity has its primary column property defined.

```typescript
if (manager.hasId(user)) {
    // ... do something
}
```

- `getId` - Gets given entity's primary column property value.
  If the entity has composite primary keys then the returned value will be an object with names and values of primary columns.

```typescript
const userId = manager.getId(user) // userId === 1
```

- `create` - Creates a new instance of `User`. Optionally accepts an object literal with user properties
  which will be written into newly created user object.

```typescript
const user = manager.create(User) // same as const user = new User();
const user = manager.create(User, {
    id: 1,
    firstName: "Timber",
    lastName: "Saw",
}) // same as const user = new User(); user.firstName = "Timber"; user.lastName = "Saw";
```

- `merge` - Merges multiple entities into a single entity.

```typescript
const user = new User()
manager.merge(User, user, { firstName: "Timber" }, { lastName: "Saw" }) // same as user.firstName = "Timber"; user.lastName = "Saw";
```

- `preload` - Creates a new entity from the given plain javascript object. If the entity already exist in the database, then
  it loads it (and everything related to it), replaces all values with the new ones from the given object,
  and returns the new entity. The new entity is actually loaded from the database entity with all properties
  replaced from the new object.

```typescript
const partialUser = {
    id: 1,
    firstName: "Rizzrak",
    profile: {
        id: 1,
    },
}
const user = await manager.preload(User, partialUser)
// user will contain all missing data from partialUser with partialUser property values:
// { id: 1, firstName: "Rizzrak", lastName: "Saw", profile: { id: 1, ... } }
```

- `save` - Saves a given entity or array of entities.
  If the entity already exists in the database, then it's updated.
  If the entity does not exist in the database yet, it's inserted.
  It saves all given entities in a single transaction (in the case of entity manager is not transactional).
  Also supports partial updating since all undefined properties are skipped. In order to make a value `NULL`, you must manually set the property to equal `null`.

```typescript
await manager.save(user)
await manager.save([category1, category2, category3])
```

- `remove` - Removes a given entity or array of entities.
  It removes all given entities in a single transaction (in the case of entity, manager is not transactional).

```typescript
await manager.remove(user)
await manager.remove([category1, category2, category3])
```

- `insert` - Inserts a new entity, or array of entities.

```typescript
await manager.insert(User, {
    firstName: "Timber",
    lastName: "Timber",
})

await manager.insert(User, [
    {
        firstName: "Foo",
        lastName: "Bar",
    },
    {
        firstName: "Rizz",
        lastName: "Rak",
    },
])
```

- `update` - Updates entities by entity id, ids, given conditions, or an array of condition objects. Sets fields from supplied partial entity.

```typescript
await manager.update(User, { age: 18 }, { category: "ADULT" })
// executes UPDATE user SET category = ADULT WHERE age = 18

await manager.update(User, 1, { firstName: "Rizzrak" })
// executes UPDATE user SET firstName = Rizzrak WHERE id = 1

// Bulk updates with different conditions for each operation
await manager.update(User, [
    { criteria: { id: 1 }, data: { firstName: "Rizzrak" } },
    { criteria: { id: 2 }, data: { firstName: "Karzzir" } },
    { criteria: { age: 18 }, data: { category: "ADULT" } },
])
// executes three separate UPDATE queries:
// UPDATE user SET firstName = Rizzrak WHERE id = 1
// UPDATE user SET firstName = Karzzir WHERE id = 2
// UPDATE user SET category = ADULT WHERE age = 18
```

You can pass an **array of condition objects** to match multiple distinct sets of rows in a single call (conditions are OR'd together):

```typescript
await manager.update(User, [{ status: "expired" }, { flagged: true }], {
    active: false,
})
// executes UPDATE user SET active = false WHERE status = 'expired' OR flagged = true
```

- `updateAll` - Updates _all_ entities of target type (without WHERE clause). Sets fields from supplied partial entity.

```typescript
await manager.updateAll(User, { category: "ADULT" })
// executes UPDATE user SET category = ADULT
```

- `upsert` - Inserts a new entity or array of entities unless they already exist in which case they are updated instead. Supported by AuroraDataApi, Cockroach, Mysql, Postgres, and Sqlite database drivers.

When an upsert operation results in an update (due to a conflict), special columns like `@UpdateDateColumn` and `@VersionColumn` are automatically updated to their current values.

Columns marked with `update: false` or defined as computed generated columns (via `asExpression`/`generatedType`) are **never** included in the update set on conflict. If all non-conflict columns are excluded by these rules (i.e. there are no updatable columns), the upsert degrades to an insert-or-ignore operation and the existing row is left completely unchanged. On databases that support conflict targets (e.g. PostgreSQL, CockroachDB), this is scoped to the specified conflict columns; on MySQL-family databases, `INSERT IGNORE` is used which applies to all unique constraints.

```typescript
await manager.upsert(
    User,
    [
        { externalId: "abc123", firstName: "Rizzrak" },
        { externalId: "bca321", firstName: "Karzzir" },
    ],
    ["externalId"],
)
/** executes
 *  INSERT INTO user
 *  VALUES
 *      (externalId = abc123, firstName = Rizzrak),
 *      (externalId = cba321, firstName = Karzzir),
 *  ON CONFLICT (externalId) DO UPDATE firstName = EXCLUDED.firstName
 **/
```

- `delete` - Deletes entities by entity id, ids, given conditions, or an array of condition objects.

```typescript
await manager.delete(User, 1)
await manager.delete(User, [1, 2, 3])
await manager.delete(User, { firstName: "Timber" })

// Bulk deletes with different conditions for each operation
await manager.delete(User, [{ firstName: "Timber" }, { age: 18 }, { id: 42 }])
// executes three separate DELETE queries:
// DELETE FROM user WHERE firstName = Timber
// DELETE FROM user WHERE age = 18
// DELETE FROM user WHERE id = 42
```

You can pass an **array of condition objects** to match multiple distinct sets of rows in a single call (conditions are OR'd together). This is different from passing a primitive array, which is treated as a list of IDs:

```typescript
// Primitive array — interpreted as WHERE id IN (1, 2, 3)
await manager.delete(User, [1, 2, 3])

// Object array — each element is a separate condition (OR'd together)
await manager.delete(User, [{ id: 1 }, { email: "old@example.com" }])
// executes DELETE FROM user WHERE id = 1 OR email = 'old@example.com'
```

Note: passing an empty object `{}` or `[{}]` throws a `TypeORMError` to prevent accidental full-table deletes.

- `deleteAll` - Deletes _all_ entities of target type (without WHERE clause).

```typescript
await manager.deleteAll(User)
// executes DELETE FROM user
```

Refer also to the `clear` method, which performs database `TRUNCATE TABLE` operation instead.

```typescript
await manager.increment(User, { firstName: "Timber" }, "age", 3)
```

```typescript
await manager.decrement(User, { firstName: "Timber" }, "age", 3)
```

```typescript
const exists = await manager.exists(User, {
    where: {
        firstName: "Timber",
    },
})
```

- `existsBy` - Checks whether any entity exists that matches `FindOptionsWhere`.

```typescript
const exists = await manager.existsBy(User, { firstName: "Timber" })
```

- `count` - Counts entities that match `FindOptions`. Useful for pagination.

```typescript
const count = await manager.count(User, {
    where: {
        firstName: "Timber",

```typescript
const timbers = await manager.findBy(User, {
    firstName: "Timber",
})
```

- `findAndCount` - Finds entities that match given `FindOptions`.
  Also counts all entities that match given conditions,
  but ignores pagination settings (from and take options).

```typescript
const [timbers, timbersCount] = await manager.findAndCount(User, {
    where: {
        firstName: "Timber",
    },
})
```

- `findAndCountBy` - Finds entities that match given `FindOptionsWhere`.
  Also counts all entities that match given conditions,
  but ignores pagination settings (from and take options).

    firstName: "Timber",
})
```

- `findOne` - Finds the first entity that matches given `FindOptions`.

const timber = await manager.findOne(User, {
    where: {
        firstName: "Timber",
    },
})
```

- `findOneBy` - Finds the first entity that matches given `FindOptionsWhere`.

```typescript
const timber = await manager.findOneBy(User, { firstName: "Timber" })
```

- `findOneOrFail` - Finds the first entity that matches some id or find options.
  Rejects the returned promise if nothing matches.

```typescript
const timber = await manager.findOneOrFail(User, {
    where: {
        firstName: "Timber",
    },
})
```

- `findOneByOrFail` - Finds the first entity that matches given `FindOptions`.
  Rejects the returned promise if nothing matches.

```typescript
const timber = await manager.findOneByOrFail(User, { firstName: "Timber" })
```

- `clear` - Clears all the data from (truncates) the given table. Supports cascade option to also clear all the data from the tables that have foreign keys to this table (supported by PostgreSQL/CockroachDB and Oracle only; other databases throw an error if cascade option is set to true).

```typescript
await manager.clear(User)

// With cascade option (PostgreSQL/CockroachDB and Oracle only)
await manager.clear(User, { cascade: true })
```
