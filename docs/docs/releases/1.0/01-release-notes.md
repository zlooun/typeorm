# Release Notes 1.0

TypeORM 1.0 is a major release that removes long-deprecated APIs, modernizes platform requirements, and ships dozens of bug fixes and new features accumulated during the 0.3.x cycle.

## Breaking changes

> See the [Upgrading Guide](./02-upgrading-from-0.3.md) for detailed upgrade instructions.

- **`invalidWhereValuesBehavior` scoped to high-level APIs only** — QueryBuilder's `.where()`, `.andWhere()`, `.orWhere()` are no longer affected by this setting ([#11878](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/pull/11878) by [@naorpeled](https://github.com/naorpeled))

## New features

### Relations & Eager loading

- **Orphaned one-to-many children with non-nullable FK are now deleted** — when saving a one-to-many relation with cascade and replacing children, orphaned rows with a non-nullable FK are now deleted instead of failing with a constraint violation; nullable FK rows are still nullified as before ([#11982](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/pull/11982) by [@naorpeled](https://github.com/naorpeled))
- **Eager relations now respect `relationLoadStrategy: "query"`** — eager relations are loaded via separate queries when the `"query"` strategy is set, instead of always using JOINs ([#11326](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/pull/11326) by [@SharkSharp](https://github.com/SharkSharp), [#12256](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/pull/12256) by [@pkuczynski](https://github.com/pkuczynski))

## Security fixes

- **SQL injection prevention** — parameterized queries and escaped identifiers are now used across all drivers for schema introspection and DDL methods, preventing SQL injection via database/schema/table/column names ([#12207](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/pull/12207) by [@pkuczynski](https://github.com/pkuczynski), [#12197](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/pull/12197) by [@pkuczynski](https://github.com/pkuczynski), [#12185](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/pull/12185) by [@pkuczynski](https://github.com/pkuczynski))
- **OrderBy condition validation** — QueryBuilder `orderBy` and `addOrderBy` now validate condition values at runtime, preventing injection via order expressions ([#12217](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/pull/12217) by [@pkuczynski](https://github.com/pkuczynski))

## Performance improvements

- **PostgreSQL / CockroachDB: batched DROP in `clearDatabase()`** — consolidates individual DROP statements into single batched queries, significantly reducing round-trips during test setup ([#12164](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/pull/12164), [#12159](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/pull/12159) by [@pkuczynski](https://github.com/pkuczynski))
